<p>
It's a familiar problem.  You've finally managed to contact that alien
civilization.  Things are going great.  You feel like your world will
never be the same, that whole new realms of possibilities are opening
up before your eyes.  Then, inevitably, a hint of strain starts to
creep into your relationship.  You find that you don't really have all
that much in common.  Heck, sometimes it feels like you're not even in
the same galaxy.  It's as if there is this vast gulf between you,
making communication almost impossible.  You're not even sure you'd
understand each other no matter how physically close you become.  What
do you do?</p>

<p>
You design a language for cosmic intercourse.  Hans Freudenthal
made a start at one in his book, Lincos, published in 1960.  
I think it's time for version II, the
all-new action-packed sequel guaranteed to have you on the edge of
your seat, which is a specific structure with a flat surface
perpendicular to the pull of gravity, which is a thing that, oh never
mind.</P>



<A NAME='goals'></A><H2>Goals of CosmicOS</H2>

<UL>

<LI>To create a complete message which, if noticed by a non-human
intelligence, stands some chance of being understood.  The message
should introduce the intelligence to a significant portion of the
human world view.<P>

<LI>To develop this message in a form that is easy to edit and extend,
so that anyone interested can simply take it and make it better
without having to track down out-of-print books.<P>

<LI>To avoid making too many assumptions about the perceptual abilities
of the non-human intelligence; for example that they make sense of 2D
images in the same way we do.  While some arguments can be made for this,
as a machine vision researcher I am very skeptical that we really 
understand the variability possible here.<P>

<LI>To send 
<A HREF='http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/'>Scheme</A> into
deep space.<P>

<LI>To send the <A HREF='http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html'>GPL</A>
into deep space.<P>

</UL>

The "intelligence" reading the message could be extra-terrestrial,
or artificial.  It is this second possibility that motivates me -- I 
want this message as a challenge for AI -- but the ET possibility is
also fun.

<A NAME='status'></A><H2>Current status</H2>

The current goal of development work on CosmicOS is to communicate
enough structure to simulate a simple MUD (multi-user dungeon) and to
use the interactions between locations, objects, and characters as an
alternative to the clever "morality plays" in Lincos.<P>

The message has a strong backbone of actual executable code.  The
results of executing code is fundamentally what gets talked about in
most of the message so far.  This has the advantage that it can be
understood on two levels: working out what the code does by looking at
its details, or just treating it as a black box and learning from
examples what it does.  It also gives the listener the ability to
do experiments using the code that are not talked about in the
message.  At the level of the MUD, this means the listener is free
to play around with the simulated world and understand its logic
through experimentation.<P>

A difficulty with using code is that it assumes the listener has
a computer to run the code on, or is computer-like enough themselves
to work through the code with excruciating patience.  I'm okay with
this assumption for now, since it is hard to imagine the message
being detected in the first place without some good hardware.<P>


<h2>Roadmap</h2>

There isn't quite a roadmap for CosmicOS yet, but development work
can be decomposed into the following activities:

<ul>

<li><B>Medium</B>: Finding the most
productive ways to encode the message in physical processes, for
transmission or long-term storage.  
</li>

<li><B>Kernel</B>: Communicating a core set of logical and
mathematical ideas, a simple programming language, and the overall
structure of the message.  
</li>

<li><B>Library</B>: Contructing a broad collection of derived concepts
from the kernel, enriching the shared language.
</li>

<li><B>Bridging</B>: Making it possible to include code written in a
conventional programming language in the message.  This is important
to simplify development, and to insulate as much of the message as
possible from changes to the kernel.  
</li>

<li><B>Alternative primers</B>: Integrating entirely different
kernels/primers into the message, to give alternate starting 
points to a reader.
</li>

<li><B>Simulations</B>: A key advantage of the algorithmic 
approach to communication is that it is possible to 
include simulations and games, to communicate about
physical and social properties by demonstrating behavior.
</li>


</ul>


<h3>Medium</h3>

This issue has been studied extensively by others, so it is dealt with
only superficially in this project.  A toy auditory form of the
message has been developed, and a few toy visualizations.  Given that
the message can be compiled to a sequence of 4 symbols, and has a very
regular structure, encoding it physically should not be difficult.

<h3>Kernel</h3>

A basic kernel has been developed, reminiscent of scheme or lisp (but
much simpified).  The major limitation currently is that there is no
treatment of real numbers yet, just integers.

<h3>Library</h3>

Again, a very basic library is in place.  The issue of efficiency
needs to be addressed -- some of the constructs used are 
very inefficient.  It seems better to go for the simplest possible
constructs, but this trade-off could be re-evaluated.

<h3>Bridging</h3>

The approach adopted here has been to support a subset of Java.
Java byte-code is translated into code that can be inserted 
into the message, and evaluated in terms of the kernel+library.
The Java support is being added step by step, and is far from
complete (and again, uses inefficient constructs to maximize
simplicity).

<h3>Alternative primers</h3>

Work on this has just begun.  Based on discussions with Brian
McConnell, logic circuits have been chosen as an alternate starting
point.  2D images of circuits have been introduced into the message,
and related to the kernel.  But a lot more needs to be done to
make this a true alternate starting point for the message.

<h3>Simulations</h3>

Pending the introduction of real numbers, there are no 
physical simulations.  There is the beginning of a
simulated adventure game with rooms and doors and
characters moving around, but it is very rudimentary
and wouldn't be very understandable yet.
